Trading Manager Design Document
1. Introduction
This document outlines the design for a modular and high-performance trading manager system. The system aims to provide a comprehensive platform for data acquisition, strategy execution, backtesting, and portfolio management, all accessible through a intuitive web-based user interface. Emphasis is placed on modularity, performance, code quality, and stability.
2. System Architecture
The system will follow a microservices-oriented architecture, with clearly defined modules communicating via well-defined APIs. This approach allows for independent development, deployment, and scaling of individual components.
2.1 Core Modules
Data Gathering Module (C#/Rust): Responsible for connecting to various data sources (exchanges, APIs, files) and ingesting raw market data.
Data Handling & Processing Module (Rust/C#): Centralized module to receive, validate, clean, normalize, and store all incoming market data. It will serve as the single source of truth for historical and real-time data for other modules.
Technical Analysis Library (C#/Rust): A high-performance library for calculating a wide range of technical indicators (moving averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.).
Strategy Runner Module (Rust): Executes trading strategies in real-time or simulated environments. It interacts with the Data Handling module for current market data and the Wallet Management module for portfolio updates.
Backtesting Engine (C#/Rust): Simulates strategy and portfolio performance on historical data. It leverages the Data Handling module for historical data and the Technical Analysis Library for indicator calculations.
Wallet Management Module (C#/Rust): Manages virtual portfolios, tracks trades, calculates P&L, applies fees, and simulates exchange interactions.
Web UI (React with Shadcn UI): Provides the user interface for strategy creation, portfolio management, backtesting configuration, data visualization, and real-time monitoring.
2.2 Technologies Choice Rationale
Rust: Ideal for performance-critical components like Data Handling, Strategy Runner, Backtesting Engine, and the Technical Analysis Library due to its memory safety, concurrency features, and raw speed.
C#: A strong contender for data gathering and wallet management due to its robust ecosystem, strong typing, and excellent tooling, offering a good balance of performance and developer productivity. Can also be used for performance-critical components if Rust proves too complex for certain parts.
Node.js: Not explicitly chosen for core modules due to the performance requirements where Rust and C# excel. However, it could be considered for lightweight API gateways or utility services if needed later.
React with Shadcn UI: Chosen for the Web UI for its component-based architecture, large community, and the aesthetic/functional benefits of Shadcn UI for building modern and responsive interfaces.

Load historical data for a specified period and instrument from the Data Handling module.
Execute strategies step-by-step over historical data.
Utilize the Technical Analysis Library for indicator calculations.
Interact with a simulated Wallet Management instance to track performance.
Generate detailed backtesting reports (P&L, drawdowns, win rate, etc.).

4. Custom Scripting Logic (Pine Code-like)
Implementation:
A custom Domain Specific Language (DSL) will be designed for strategy definition.
This DSL will be parsed into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
A custom interpreter (or a transpiler to a performant language like Rust) will execute the AST within the Strategy Runner and Backtesting Engine.
The DSL should provide access to historical price data, technical indicators, and common arithmetic/logical operations.
Example Syntax (Conceptual):
code
Code
// Define an indicator
sma50 = sma(close, 50)
sma200 = sma(close, 200)

// Define a buy condition
buy_condition = crossover(sma50, sma200)

// Define a sell condition
sell_condition = crossunder(sma50, sma200)

// Execute actions
if buy_condition:
    buy(market, 100%)
if sell_condition:
    sell(market, 100%)
5. Data Flow
Data Sources (Exchanges, APIs, Files) provide raw market data (websockets/REST) to the Data Gathering Module.
The Data Gathering Module processes and forwards this data to the Data Handling & Processing Module.
The Data Handling & Processing Module stores historical data and provides real-time data feeds. It also serves historical data to the Backtesting Engine.
The Technical Analysis Library is utilized by both the Strategy Runner and Backtesting Engine for indicator calculations based on data from the Data Handling module.
The Strategy Runner receives real-time data from Data Handling, applies strategies, and sends trade signals to the Wallet Management Module.
The Backtesting Engine simulates strategies on historical data, interacting with a simulated Wallet Management Module instance.
The Web UI interacts with all relevant modules for:
Strategy editing and deployment (to Strategy Runner/Backtesting Engine).
Portfolio management (with Wallet Management).
Data visualization (from Data Handling).
Backtest results and reports (from Backtesting Engine).
6. Performance, Quality, and Stability
